![Screen Shot 2021-07-09 at 2 49 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9034190/125123591-d794d800-e0c4-11eb-9645-17d2022ec1f1.png)

## Why
I just installed an Untangle firewall appliance in my home network. I like it a lot. Great functionality, easy to use, great reports, very low resource usage. As a typical Grafana user, I needed to GRAPH ALL THE THINGS! Untangle is open source and even uses a standard PostgreSQL database. Grafana supports PostgreSQL so connecting the two should be easy. Well, nothing is ever easy is it? ðŸ˜ƒ
