# Untangle PostgreSQL Grafana Dashboards

![Screen Shot 2021-07-09 at 6 24 28 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9034190/125141381-eee2be00-e0e2-11eb-8385-c06f5952f9e3.png)

## Why
I just installed an Untangle firewall appliance in my home network. I like it a lot. Great functionality, easy to use, great reports, very low resource usage. As a typical Grafana user, I needed to GRAPH ALL THE THINGS! Untangle is open source and even uses a standard PostgreSQL database. Grafana supports PostgreSQL so connecting the two should be easy. Well, nothing is ever easy is it? ðŸ˜ƒ

## How
### Parts List
* Grafana Up and Running ([Guide](http://blog.faucher.net/2021/02/grafana-101-part-i.html))
* Untangle Up and Running ([Guide](https://www.untangle.com/untangle-ng-firewall/resources/how-to-deploy/))

### Open Up Untangle Firewall to Allow Internal PostgreSQL Access

Untangle, being an exellent security appliance, is locked down tight.  The only access to the appliance are very tightly controlled SSH, HTTPS, RADIUS, DNS, DHCP and a few other internal-only ports. We want to allow access to the PostgreSQL port (5432) from the internal network (Grafana). 

In the Untangle web interface go to Config > Network > Advanced > Access Rules. Add this rule:

Move the rule up to the top and click Save.

### Open Up Untangle PostgreSQL Database to Other Hosts
My Grafana server is separate from my Untangle appliance naturally. Although I could access PostgreSQL by ssh-ing into the Untangle appliance and typing "psql -U postgres",  typing "psql -U postgres -h untangle" got me nowhere. After some research, I learned that PostgreSQL is only acessible by localhost by default. Smart. One needs to edit two PostgreSQL files to allow access from other hosts - postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf. In postgresql.conf change 'localhost' to '*' and in pg_bha_conf add the a line that points to your internal network like "host all all 192.168.1.0/24 trust". I found [this guide](https://www.bigbinary.com/blog/configure-postgresql-to-allow-remote-connection) helpful.

````bash
/etc/postgresql/11/main/postgresql.conf
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'         # what IP address(es) to listen on;
listen_addresses = '*'                  # what IP address(es) to listen on;
                                        # comma-separated list of addresses;
                                        # defaults to 'localhost'; use '*' for all
                                        # (change requires restart)

/etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    all             all             192.168.1.0/24            trust
````

After editing these two files run the command
````bash
systemctl restart postgresql
````
to enable your changes. Now running the command
````bash
psql -U postgres -h untangle
````
should work (as long as you use the correct hostname/IP address after -h).

### Add Untangle PostgreSQL as a Grafana Data Source
